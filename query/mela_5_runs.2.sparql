# Each :SequencingRun in grafli generally has multiple samples from multiple
# donors in different lanes. Moreover we don't capture runDate on them, which
# is a required field for the beacon experimental run model.
#
# Possible workaround: construct an artifical "run" working up from the ARGS
# level, and attach the platform and library strategy info to that.
# What to use for runId? Something artificial like run:[ARGS uuid].
# What to use for date? Perhaps the date of the submission of the ReadGroups?
